# prime-services
Prime-calculating services in REST and gRPC

## Build system

This project is built with sbt, mostly because I used it a little in the past
and I wanted to refresh my memory. :wink:

Gradle would have been a valid alternative, but I became quite confident with
it recently, and I really wanted to use something different.
